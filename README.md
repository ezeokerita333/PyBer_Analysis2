# Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to showcase the relationship between the number of drivers and riders and its fares in order to help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability in all city types espiecially for the underserved neighborhoods.

# Results
The result ride sharing data which shows the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare in all city types. The city types which include Rural, Urban and Suburban, it was noticed that;
 - Rural : This had the lowest total fare, rides and drivers but the highest average fare rate per driver and ride.
 - Suburban : This had a fair amount of total fare, rides and drivers and also a fair amount of average fare rate per driver and ride.
 - Urban : This had the highest total fare, rides and drivers but the lowest average fare rate per driver and ride.
In conclusion, the Urban city had the highest recorded amount of drivers booked as a result of the lower rate of amount charged per ride and per driver in the city, thus, leading to a high recorded number of rides booked and higest fares recorded to have been gotten.

# Summary
In my own opinion, I can explain some business recommendations that should be considered by the CEO in addressing the disparities among the city types;
 - She can lower cost of fare per ride and fare per driver, which can help increase the number rides taken by people in that city especially for the rural    and suburban cities.
 - She can increase the number of drivers for the Rural and Suburban city regions, which might help reduce the high cost of rides charged .
 - She can also decide to take advantage of the urban city by increasing the fares to increase revenue gotten since there are more drivers and more rides      been booked. Lastly, Since we have limited data on why the Urban city rides is the highest, She can decided to look more into it in order to use the        format for the other cities to increase the drivers or thr rides booked.
